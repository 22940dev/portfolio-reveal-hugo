# Configuration

---

## Reveal.js themes

Put in `config.toml` or a presentation's front matter.

Use the `theme` key for themes that come with Reveal.js.

```toml
[params.reveal_hugo]
theme = "moon"
highlight_theme = "zenburn"
```

## Use a custom theme

Use the `custom_theme` key to point to a CSS file in the `static` directory.

```toml

custom_theme = "reveal-hugo/themes/robot-lung.css"
```

history = true

```

## Extending the layout

Use partials to add HTML to the page at the closing of the head and the body tags, either for all presentations or just a specific one.

This is the recommended way to add script and style tags to customize your presentations.

---

Here is where partials go for different presentations and places on the page.
<br><br>

| Presentation | Before &lt;/head&gt;            | Before &lt;/body&gt;            |
|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| All          | reveal-hugo/head.html           | reveal-hugo/body.html           |
| Root         | home/reveal-hugo/head.html      | home/reveal-hugo/body.html      |
| Section      | {section}/reveal-hugo/head.html | {section}/reveal-hugo/body.html |

---

## Example customization

In `home/reveal-hugo/head.html`:

```html
<style>
.reveal section h1 {
  color: blue;
}
</style>
```

In `home/reveal-hugo/body.html`:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
Reveal.addEventListener('slidechanged', function(event) {
  console.log("üéûÔ∏è Slide is now " + event.indexh);
});
</script>
```
